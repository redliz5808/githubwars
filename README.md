# To Run This App:

## Add the .env file
Please create a .env file in the root folder which contains the following line of code:
- REACT_APP_GITHUB_SECRET_TOKEN=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

## Run npm install
- From the terminal, navigate to the project folder. 
- run `npm install`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Initial Test
Integrated React App using Apollo GraphQL

## Requirements

- Must use a 3rd party Public GraphQL API available on the internet (Most of them are free)
- A small react app only (Example, just display the data being fetched on the GraphQL query and add styling to it)
- You can add more functionalities to it as you like, as long as it doesn't get big

## Instructions

- Create a simple React App using this free Public GraphQL APIs  [https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-apis](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-apis) [https://moonhighway.com/public-graphql-apis/](https://moonhighway.com/public-graphql-apis/) or you can check more on the internet on any available APIs, as long as it's GraphQL
- You can use any UI Library (Bootstrap/Tailwind/Ant Design/Chakra UI and etc...)
- Must be written in latest version of React
- Use Apollo Client
- Create a github repository for this one and send it to **kim@hov.co**
